# FAIR data assessments

Any of the following tools can be used to ascertain how Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable a dataset is. Assessment tools can be into manual/self-assessment tools and automatic tools. 

## Self assessment tools
#### [SATIFYD - Self-Assessment Tool to Improve the FAIRness of Your Dataset](https://satifyd.dans.knaw.nl/)
A questionnaire with 3 questions for each 'letter'. 
#### [ARDC fair self-assessment tool](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/working-with-data/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool/)
 This self-assessment tool has been designed predominantly for data librarians and IT staff, but could be used by software engineers developing FAIR data tools and services, and researchers provided they have assistance from research support staff. Contains 12 questions.
#### [Checklist for evaluation of dataset fitness for use](https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/Checklist%20for%20Evaluation%20of%20Dataset%20Fitness%20for%20Use%20Questions.pdf)
PDF checklist for use by repository managers or a similar external entity to evaluate the data holdings of
repository for fitness for use. 
#### [How FAIR are your data](https://zenodo.org/record/1065991)
Checklist of 16 questions in presentation form created for EUDAT summer school
#### [FAIRdat-tool](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/fairdat)
Surveymonkey prototype of what will eventually be developed as an automatic assessment tool.
#### [5 Star Data Rating tool](http://oznome.csiro.au/5star/)
Easy to fill in website form that yields immediate results.
#### [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/features.html)
Wizard that helps with data stewardship. Evaluates answers in FAIR metrics and allows for the generation of a 'data management plan'.
## Automatic assessment tools
#### [FAIR evaluation Services / FAIR Evaluator](https://fairsharing.github.io/FAIR-Evaluator-FrontEnd/#!/#%2F!)
Among contributors are Mark D. Wilkinson and Michel Dumontier. Maturity Indicators can be imported as smartAPI yaml, indicators can then be assembled into collections which are used to evaluate resources.
#### [Metadata Quality Assurance](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/mqa/?locale=en)
Hosted by the European Data Portal. Methodology is described [here](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/mqa/methodology?locale=en). 
#### [FAIRshake](fairshake.cloud)
Evaluates the FAIRness of digital objects using metrics from FAIRmetrics.org. Extension/bookmark can be used to submit a FAIR assessment. Seems focussed on the biomedical field.
